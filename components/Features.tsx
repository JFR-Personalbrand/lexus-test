    <p className='text-left text-dark-normal text-xs leading-5'>
    When taking a look at both models, it’s clear to the naked eye that the Lexus RX 350 outclasses its competitor, 
    and here is why. This crossover will display dynamic dimensions from its well-sculpted hood to its razor-sharp 
    lines that flow evenly across the body in a sweeping motion. This particular redesign showcases next-level 
    aesthetics via jewel-like headlamps, LED-Blade taillamps, and a signature spindle grille.

    The Volvo XC 90 for 2023 retains many of its previous characteristics via “Thor-Hammer” headlamps and asymmetrical 
    taillamps. This SUV has a great stance and sophisticated charm, but the RX 350 displays an athletic stance and 
    electrifying aggression. The RX 350’s 21-inch wheels will provide a great riding perception, and the window trim 
    flows around the frame in a continuous motion. The XC 90 could use a bit more detail for its exterior to even come 
    close to matching the exterior appearance that Lexus has brought to the table. Germain Lexus will host numerous trims 
    such as the Standard, 350 Premium, and 500 Sport. A number of pearl finishes for the exterior are also available, 
    including Cavier, Nori green, and Matador red.

    <p className='text-left text-dark-normal text-xs leading-5'>
    Lexus 2023 and Volvo 2023 have remained true to their performance goals as both of these new models will provide a
     comfortable drive. The RX 350 goes beyond luxury and has incorporated high-performance into the mix via a 
     multitude of advanced powertrains. Some of the brand’s models are forced inducted while others have electric 
     motors. Four-cylinder engines are used, and turbocharging has been added for swifter acceleration. Horsepower will 
     range from 246 to 275. Lexus 2023 goes further with its F-Sport division. The RX 500h F-Sport trim will provide the 
     ultimate road performance by offering all-wheel drive, adaptive variable suspension, and 366 horsepower.

    <p className='text-left text-dark-normal text-xs leading-5'>                  
    The Volvo XC 90 is ideal for daily driving, but high performance may be out of the question. This road warrior has a
     larger frame, and its air suspension and shock absorbers will soak up road bumps for a comfortable drive. Its hybrid 
     powertrain does provide 455 horsepower to push the SUV’s heavy body down the highway. All-around capability easily 
     goes to the new Lexus RX 350 because you’ll get the best of both worlds in terms of raw performance and comfort.
